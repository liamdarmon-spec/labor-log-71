-- PLACEHOLDER (remote migration history alignment)
-- ============================================================================
-- This file exists because a prior `supabase db pull` generated a migration with
-- this timestamp/name and it was accidentally pushed/applied to at least one
-- environment. We keep this file as a NO-OP so local migration history matches
-- remote and `supabase db push` can proceed deterministically.
--
-- DO NOT DELETE without first repairing migration history in the target DB:
--   supabase migration repair --status reverted 20260113200754
